# TwoStnTomoLab
This is a teaching exercise to introduce students with no background to seismic tomography to seismic tomography. During this exercise, students will work through the process of making measurements of phase and group times of Rayleigh waves, solving a tomographic problem "by hand" numerically and finally, working with a real dataset of Rayleigh wave phase traveltimes and solving for an image of the Continental U.S. 

Please follow the instructions in lab1.pdf. The lab requires MATLAB and requires downloading all the .mat files that have been available here.
